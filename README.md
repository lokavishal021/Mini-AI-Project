Here’s a **clean and professional GitHub description** (README-style) you can use for your Flask Virtual Assistant project 👇

---

## 🧠 Flask Virtual Assistant

An **AI-powered virtual assistant web app** built using **Flask**, integrating multiple intelligent modules for automation, file understanding, natural language interaction, and real-time web functionalities.

---

### 🚀 Features

#### 💬 **Conversational Assistant**

* Responds naturally to greetings and questions.
* Can answer general knowledge queries using **Wikipedia API**.
* Supports **basic and advanced math solving** using `SymPy`.
* Can **tell stories**, explain diseases, and generate summaries.

#### 📁 **Smart Document Reader**

* Supports **PDF**, **DOCX**, and **TXT** file uploads.
* Extracts and reads text content.
* Offers two modes:

  * 📖 *Read Out* → Reads the entire document.
  * ✨ *Summarize* → Extracts main points and concise summaries.

#### 🧮 **Math Solver**

* Basic arithmetic parsing (e.g., “12 plus 8 divided by 2”).
* Symbolic math operations:

  * `solve(x^2 - 4 = 0)`
  * `differentiate x^3 + 2x`
  * `integrate sin(x)`
  * `simplify (x^2 + 2x)/x`

#### 🩺 **Health Assistant**

* Provides basic info on common diseases like **cold**, **fever**, **malaria**, **COVID-19**, etc.
* Includes symptoms, causes, and treatments.

#### 📰 **Current Affairs Fetcher**

* Fetches **top 5 headlines** from India using the **NewsAPI** (real-time).

#### 🖼️ **Image Captioning (BLIP Model)**

* Automatically generates image captions using the **Salesforce BLIP model**.
* Detects potential weapons in images and issues warnings.

#### ⚙️ **Dynamic Code Snippets**

* Reads and serves predefined code examples from a `programs.json` file.
